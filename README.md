### About Puzzel Collect

Puzzel Collect is a complete tool for humanitarian, non-government and all other businesses that rely on either collecting donations, members or volunteer fundraisers. 

The product includes SMS, IVR, social media and web-interfaces that handles donations, payment, recruiting, membership databases, statistics, widgets and much more. Please see our [webpages](https://www.puzzel.com/no/betalingslosning/innsamling/collect/) for further information. 

### Where to start?

At the moment we provide two APIs for integration:

- [Push API](Push.md) - Pushes info about new donations or members to your server-side using HTTP POST or GET.
- [Rest API](Rest.md) - Integrate your system with our REST API.


### Registering an account
