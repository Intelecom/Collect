# Collect API
## Official documentation

Welcome to the developer pages for the Intelecom Collect APIs. Here you will find all you need to integrate Collect into your existing applications / systems.

### About Intelecom Collect

Intelecom Collect is a complete tool for humanitarian, non-government and all other businesses that rely on either collecting donations, members or volunteer fundraisers. 

The product includes SMS, IVR, social media and web-interfaces that handles donations, payment, recruiting, membership databases, statistics, widgets and much more. Please see our [webpages](https://www.intelecom.no/vare-losninger/betaling/innsamling/collect/) for further information. 

### Where to start?

At the moment we provide two APIs for integration:

- Push API - Pushes info about new donations or members to your server-side using HTTP POST or GET.
- Rest API - Integrate your system towards our REST API (COMING SOON)


### Registering an account

To test the Collect APIs you will need a live or demo account.


If you do not already have an account and want to try out or order access, please do [contact us](/Contact.md) for more information. We provide demo accounts with no strings attached. 

For live accounts pricing is based on establishment, monthly subscription and traffic (per message) fees. 


### About Intelecom 

Intelecom is a leading provider of cloud-based and on-premise communication solutions. We have over 30 years of experience and with our experience and competence we aim to give our customers stable, flexible, user-friendly and scalable solutions. 

We provide innovative solutions for SMS, mobile applications, system integration, call-centers, wireless networks, unified communications and more. Our customer base counts over 2000 customers across many verticals from offshore to transport, primarily in Scandinavia and UK. What most of our customers have in common is that they have a need to be able to communicate better with their users and employees. Our contribution is often that we offer means to integrate existing solutions with new ones or new interfaces. This results in continuous utilization of current investments and at the same time providing additional value for the customer. Our mission is to make sure that good communication is rewarding. 

SMS solutions have been a part of Intelecom starting with the platform originally set up by Carrot Communications back in 2000. Since then not a lot have changed in the basic SMS GSM specifications, but a lot have changed concerning our customers' demands for stability, scalability, redundancy and speed. SMS now is a business critical application for many companies, both private and public. In addition, a lot has happened with SMS as a payment channel over the years. In later years many telcos have been opening up for selling physical goods and services, using SMS or carrier billing as payment. We at Intelecom have been working hard to keep up, both with customer demands and new possibilities over the years. As a result, we have a SMS platform, now in it's fifth major version, that is both technically advanced, high-capacity and stable.
